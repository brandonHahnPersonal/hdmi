TIMING-6#1 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_fpga_0 and clk_out1_brandonBlockDesign_clk_wiz_0_1 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_fpga_0] -to [get_clocks clk_out1_brandonBlockDesign_clk_wiz_0_1]
Related violations: <none>

No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_fpga_0 and clk_out1_brandonBlockDesign_clk_wiz_0_1_1 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_fpga_0] -to [get_clocks clk_out1_brandonBlockDesign_clk_wiz_0_1_1]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#3 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_out1_brandonBlockDesign_clk_wiz_0_1 and clk_out1_brandonBlockDesign_clk_wiz_0_1_1 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware.

TIMING-51#1 Critical Warning
No common phase between related clocks from parallel CMBs  
The clocks clk_fpga_0 and clk_out1_brandonBlockDesign_clk_wiz_0_1 are timed together but have no phase relationship. The design could fail in hardware. The clocks originate from two parallel Clock Modifying Blocks and at least one of the MMCM or PLLs clock dividers is not set to 1. To be safely timed, all MMCMs or PLLs involved in parallel clocking must have the clock divider set to 1.
Related violations: <none>

The clocks clk_fpga_0 and clk_out1_brandonBlockDesign_clk_wiz_0_1_1 are timed together but have no phase relationship. The design could fail in hardware. The clocks originate from two parallel Clock Modifying Blocks and at least one of the MMCM or PLLs clock dividers is not set to 1. To be safely timed, all MMCMs or PLLs involved in parallel clocking must have the clock divider set to 1.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert

TIMING-20#1 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch brandonBlockDesign_i/gameTopMod_0/inst/nolabel_line28/VDE_reg cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin brandonBlockDesign_i/gameTopMod_0/inst/nolabel_line28/VDE_reg/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-56#1 Warning
Missing logically or physically excluded clock groups constraint  
Multiple clocks are user generated or auto-derived on the source pin brandonBlockDesign_i/clk_wiz_0/inst/mmcm_adv_inst/CLKFBOUT but are not logically or physically exclusive with respect to one another. To have the static timing analysis match the behavior in hardware, there cannot be multiple clocks generated on the same pin and when such situation occurs, the clocks should be defined as physically or logically exclusive. The list of clocks generated on the source pin is: clkfbout_brandonBlockDesign_clk_wiz_0_1
clkfbout_brandonBlockDesign_clk_wiz_0_1_1
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-56#2 Warning
Missing logically or physically excluded clock groups constraint  
Multiple clocks are user generated or auto-derived on the source pin brandonBlockDesign_i/clk_wiz_0/inst/mmcm_adv_inst/CLKOUT0 but are not logically or physically exclusive with respect to one another. To have the static timing analysis match the behavior in hardware, there cannot be multiple clocks generated on the same pin and when such situation occurs, the clocks should be defined as physically or logically exclusive. The list of clocks generated on the source pin is: clk_out1_brandonBlockDesign_clk_wiz_0_1
clk_out1_brandonBlockDesign_clk_wiz_0_1_1
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-56#3 Warning
Missing logically or physically excluded clock groups constraint  
Multiple clocks are user generated or auto-derived on the source pin brandonBlockDesign_i/clk_wiz_0/inst/mmcm_adv_inst/CLKOUT1 but are not logically or physically exclusive with respect to one another. To have the static timing analysis match the behavior in hardware, there cannot be multiple clocks generated on the same pin and when such situation occurs, the clocks should be defined as physically or logically exclusive. The list of clocks generated on the source pin is: clk_out2_brandonBlockDesign_clk_wiz_0_1
